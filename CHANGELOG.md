## Changelog
It took a long time, but now it's here; Documentation! This update includes a lot of documentation in the repository, as well as in git phlow. All the commands have been updated to show the same documentation as the one found on our github repository. 
We also updated our pipeline setup and tasks, but that stuff is mostly for our own sake.

We always welcome updates to our documentation, so if you feel like contributing, you should.  

#### Bug Fixes
