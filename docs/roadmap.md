# git-phlow roadmap
> the long road of becoming an automation tool

below you find the roadmap of git-phlow, which will show the path of the project in the future. The project is open source and the more hands we get helping us reaching our vision the quicker er get there. 

If you have any suggestion you would like to see in the future, create an issue for it and the benevolent dictator @groenborg, will see if it fits, or can be priortized higher. 

## ðŸš€ roadmap

### Updated documentation
 - updated documentation for entire tool. It is a mess right now, and we are not afraid to admit it.
> near future

 ### GitLab support
 - we need to support that sly old fox as well. See Github issues for whats in store.
 > near future


 ### agent commands
 - We moved forward a little too fast, and some old features got ditched in the process. Not good!
 > March 2018

### bitbucket support
- Big brother Jira got its support before hand, maybe it is time to give little brother a hand too.
